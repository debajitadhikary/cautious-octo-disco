# Striver's Must-Do Pattern Problems

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing solutions to the "Must Do Pattern Problems Before Starting DSA" from [TakeUForward](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/must-do-pattern-problems-before-starting-dsa/). This collection includes implementations of 22 foundational pattern problems designed to build logic and problem-solving skills before diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). All solutions are coded in [C++], and this repo serves as a reference for anyone starting their DSA journey.

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the pattern problems outlined in Striver's A2Z DSA Course. These exercises focus on mastering nested loops and pattern printing, which are essential for developing a strong programming foundation. Each pattern is implemented as a standalone program, making it easy to understand and replicate.

## Pattern Problems Included

Here’s a list of all 22 patterns covered in this repository, as presented in the TakeUForward article:

1. **Pattern 1: Solid Square**  
   - A square of asterisks (`*`) with equal rows and columns.

2. **Pattern 2: Right Triangle**  
   - A right-angled triangle of asterisks growing row by row.

3. **Pattern 3: Numbered Right Triangle**  
   - A right triangle where each row contains the row number repeated.

4. **Pattern 4: Inverted Numbered Right Triangle**  
   - A right triangle with numbers decreasing from the row number.

5. **Pattern 5: Inverted Right Triangle**  
   - An inverted right-angled triangle of asterisks.

6. **Pattern 6: Pyramid**  
   - A centered pyramid of asterisks with increasing width.

7. **Pattern 7: Inverted Pyramid**  
   - An inverted pyramid of asterisks with decreasing width.

8. **Pattern 8: Diamond**  
   - A diamond shape formed by combining a pyramid and its inverted version.

9. **Pattern 9: Half Diamond**  
   - A half-diamond pattern with asterisks increasing then decreasing.

10. **Pattern 10: Right Half Diamond**  
    - A right-aligned half-diamond with asterisks.

11. **Pattern 11: Binary Number Triangle**  
    - A triangle with alternating 0s and 1s.

12. **Pattern 12: Number Crown**  
    - A pattern with numbers increasing and decreasing symmetrically.

13. **Pattern 13: Increasing Number Triangle**  
    - A triangle with continuously increasing numbers.

14. **Pattern 14: Alphabet Triangle**  
    - A triangle with alphabets from A onwards in each row.

15. **Pattern 15: Inverted Alphabet Triangle**  
    - An inverted triangle with alphabets decreasing row by row.

16. **Pattern 16: Alphabet Pyramid**  
    - A pyramid with alphabets increasing up to the middle row.

17. **Pattern 17: Symmetric Alphabet Pyramid**  
    - A pyramid with alphabets forming a symmetric pattern.

18. **Pattern 18: Inverted Alphabet Diamond**  
    - A diamond with alphabets decreasing from the edges.

19. **Pattern 19: Symmetric Butterfly**  
    - A butterfly pattern with asterisks forming symmetric wings.

20. **Pattern 20: Hollow Diamond**  
    - A hollow diamond outline with asterisks.

21. **Pattern 21: Hollow Square with Diagonal**  
    - A hollow square with asterisks on borders and diagonals.

22. **Pattern 22: Number Square**  
    - A square with numbers decreasing towards the center.

## Repository Structure

- Each pattern has its own file (e.g., `pattern1.cpp`, `pattern2.cpp`, etc.).
- Files are named according to the pattern number for easy reference.
- Code is well-commented to explain the logic behind each pattern.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/strivers-pattern-problems.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired pattern file.
3. Compile and run the C++ code using a compiler like `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern1.cpp -o pattern1
   ./pattern1
   ```
4. Explore the output and modify the code as needed!

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of loops and pattern logic.
